Privated bot for now, hard coded channel ids (no longer hard coded, but it still only works on 1 server. will make DB or something to make it public hosted by me.), will be public hosted by me soon.

## How to fork the bot to use it for your own use.

1. Either Fork the bot on GitHub, or clone it.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, in the directory you installed the bot in.
3. Run the bot and answer the questions it gives you. (Make sure you have a bot setup on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
4. Finished! (Contact me for errors.)

## Known Bugs.
1. If you react to any message in the server with a âœ…, the bot will say you are ready in chat.
2. Spamming is still an issue.
