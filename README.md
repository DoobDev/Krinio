Privated bot for now, hard coded channel ids, will be public hosted by me soon.

## How to fork the bot to use it for your own use.

1. Either Fork the bot on GitHub, or clone it.
2. Replace the channel IDs and on line 64, 74, 85, 113.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, in the directory you installed the bot in.
4. Run the bot. (Make sure you have a bot setup on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
5. Finished! (Contact me for errors.)

## Known Bugs.
1. If you react to any message in the server with a âœ…, the bot will say you are ready in chat.
2. Spamming is still an issue.
