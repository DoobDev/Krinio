Privated bot for now, hard coded channel ids (no longer hard coded, but it still only works on 1 server. will make DB or something to make it public hosted by me.), will be public hosted by me soon.

## How to use the bot.
![Example Gif](https://i.imgur.com/8HPH1HJ.gif)

1. Setup the bot using the instructions below.
2. Once you have the bot running, I would recoment running the "!help" command, which gives you all the commands.
3. To start a game with a ping, do !start.
4. To send the code to your code channel, do !code {code}

## How to fork the bot to use it for your own use.

1. Either Fork the bot on GitHub, or clone it.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, in the directory you installed the bot in.
3. Edit channel ids on lines 59, 69, 79, and 108
4. Run the bot. (Make sure you have a bot setup on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
5. Finished! (Contact me for errors.)

## Known Bugs.
1. Spamming is still an issue.
